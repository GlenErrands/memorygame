# Glen Errand's Swing Memory Game

This is a small experimental game written in Java/Swing.

## Instructions

1.  Open the Program by executing `io.github.glenerrands.memorygame.SwingMemoryGame.main`
1.  Choose a directory containing images in the file dialog that appears. Don't descent into the directory, just select it!
1.  Select the desired number of players.
1.  Select the number of tile groups (i.e. tile pairs with the same image).
1.  Select the ratings you would like to include when the game randomly chooses images for your upcoming game.
1.  Click "OK" and start playing by clicking on the tiles. 
1.  If a player uncovers two tiles with the same image, the image is displayed enlarged, and the player can rate it (Don't show again/Show again/Favourite). This rating can be used in future game sessions e.g. to play only with images that has been rated as favourite.
